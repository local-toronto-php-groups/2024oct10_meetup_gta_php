Come on down to 7shifts for our first meet-up of the 2024-'25 season.

6:00pm to 7:00pm: 

- meet-and-greet, pizza and beverages generously sponsored by 7shifts

7:00pm to 9:00pm: 

- notes on the meet-ups, by Bob, Lead Organizer
- my own personal project, by Bob
- devs take the podium!

Something we have been doing more of, over the last few years, is opening the podium to our passionate developers. So that we can introduce ourselves to each other, share our passion projects -- which is quite amazing that so many of our fellow devs have something cooking  --- and ask their burning questions. 

Even though it seems like without a presentation, there is no learning opportunities, it is fascinating to see what our peers are doing in real life. 

Our last meet-up on Property Hooks in June seems like a while ago. Looking forward to seeing you on the 10th!
